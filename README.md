# PasswordGenerator

## Abstract
I am a Computer Science student at Clemson and want to make more projects. Reasons why are coding is a passion of mine and I would love to learn more about it.
Getting better and being more knowledegable is the main goal. I would also like to have things to add to my resume. So I am planing to make serval projects
to show my worth. This is my first project.

## Introduction of Project
I want to make a Password Generator. Meaning that I want to make a hub for people to place their passwords. I know this sounds like not a good idea but I think it 
will be good experinece. This is my first C# project and any experience with windows froms. This is also my first project using sql. I want to use these features 
and learn from them. I want to make a secure and convient place to put my passwords. The intial idea is that this is just for myself but I maybe can have other people
use it as well.

## Objectives
* Algorithms 
* File Use
* Encryption
* Design

### Algorithms
I have to create a algorithm that actually makes a good password. That is the core of the project so I have to make sure it is good. How I did this was using general
password logic. Strong passwords have four key things. The length of the password is the main thing. A strong password has 8 to 12 characters. So I made it so you can 
make it up to 18 character for those passwords that need to be really secure. The rest of the variables are letter, numbers, and special characters. Including all
different types of these in a password makes it harder and harder to guess. So you have the option of all of them. I used the website https://www.passwordmonster.com/ 
to help see how strong it is.
